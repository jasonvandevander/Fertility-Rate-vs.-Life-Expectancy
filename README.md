# Fertility-Rate-vs.-Life-Expectancy

I produced a scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and
Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country.
The scatterplot needed to also be categorised by Countriesâ€™ Regions.

I have been supplied with data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and was required
to produce a visualisation for each of these years.
Some data has been provided in a csv file, some - in R vectors. The csv file contains
combined data for both years. All data manipulations have been performed in R. 
I was able to provide insights into how the two periods compare.
